A group tour day in London for over 100 people.

While in London it was really important to everyone to still be able to give something. Mumford & Sites, separate from the celebrations at Omeara and separate from our Peace Band campaign - we sold wristbands on the day and raised **$5,000 / £4,000** for War Child UK.

Double Decker Bus touring all the key Mumford locations plus a few extra special fun stops.

Originally planned for 22 February 2022-2022/2022, Agora X fundraised over **$51,000 / £39,000** as Crowdfunder and other offers from #teamOmeara and #teamventures, to earn an amazing takeover of the Omeara venue in London for up to 575 people, known as The Big Party!

And...WE DID IT!

The funds were raised, the party happened on 24 October 2022 with guest DJ Nick Etwell, featuring both live boozy and sober Champagne Method and THEE PEOPLE. A truly epic night with Agora finally together!

But our one night Party turned into a week long celebration of shared experiences, dining tours, wine trips, afternoon teas, dinners, shows, and sporting matches, all around together with our amazing Agora community and TPTB Agoraverse.
