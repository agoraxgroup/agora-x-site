While in London it was really important to everyone to still be able to do something with our beloved London based charity partner, War Child UK, separate from the celebrations at Omeara. And of course everyone wanted to see all the significant Mumford locations… So what better way than to arrange a tour around London on Double Decker Bus seeing all the Mumford & Sites. We picniced in Shepherd Bush, shared a pint at Worlds End pub, took endless photos at every stop, walked Hampstead Heath, sang our hearts out on the bus, laughed, cried, heard incredibly moving and meaningful stories of children in conflict from War Child CEO Rob Williams and Jim Benner, Global Music Lead, who joined us for the afternoon.

We raised close to **$5,000**.

Originally planned for 22 February 2022 (22/2/2022). Agora X fundraised over **$51,000 / £39,000** via Crowdfunder and other efforts for #saveOmeara and #saveourvenues, to earn an amazing takeover of the Omeara venue in London for up to 375 people, known as The Big Party!

And.... WE DID IT!

The funds were raised, the party happened on 24 October 2022 with guest DJ (Mr Lovett himself), Ted sharing both his honey and latest Champagne Method Cider and over 250 amazing Agorables! The drinks, the food, the venue, 2/3 of our lads, numerous special guests, communion artists performing and THE PEOPLE. A truly epic night with Agora finally Together!

But our one night Party turned into a week long celebration of shared experiences, doing tours, side trips, afternoon teas, dinners, shows, and sporting matches, all shared together with our amazing Agora community and full of AgoraLove!
