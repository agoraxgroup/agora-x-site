## The Story of Agora X

Agora X is a group of Agora members who came together during COVID to focus on charitable efforts. We came together originally to purchase The Big Party at Omeara in London- which we, as a group, were able to do- and we had a blast celebrating last October.

Since our formation in May 2020, we've raised over **$140,000 / £110,000** in various efforts benefitting various charities, such as War Child UK, Children in Conflict, Grenfell Foundation, etc. Efforts range in involvement, from marathons, to a simple purchase of a bracelet.

We've gotten a private concert from Marcus, had a private tasting of Ted's cider, had Ben DJ for us, raffled off a Marcus signed football signed especially for Agora, chatted with Marcus Haney, and watched Ross Stirling climb the Matterhorn. We've infiltrated homes with bracelets, ornaments, posters, t-shirts, and pens. We've chatted on Zooms and hugged in person in London. We've celebrated the victories of buying The Big Party, reaching a large donation goal, and helped clean each other's merch closet out with our Chris Maas market.

In 2023 we raised over **$14,000** with contributions to War Child, Children In Conflict and the Grenfell campaign.

Through the past year, our Agora X community has donated to various targeted fundraising efforts, including the Syria/Turkey earthquake, Afghanistan appeal, Violence in Israel and Gaza, as well as worked with CIC and WC to create our own stand alone platform pages for Agora.

With every effort, the 7 admins of Agora X all gather on Zoom to talk about the effort and each time we say the same thing…. **"We're blown away by our amazing community"**.
