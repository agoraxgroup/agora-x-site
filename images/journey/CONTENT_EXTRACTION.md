### Complete Journey Story

#### Paragraph 1 - Origin Story
Agora X is a group of Agora members who came together during COVID to focus on charitable efforts. We came together originally to purchase The Big Party at Omeara in London- which we, as a group, were able to do- and we had a blast celebrating last October.

#### Paragraph 2 - Fundraising Achievements
Since our formation in May 2020, we've raised over $140.000 / ₤110.000 in various efforts benefitting various charities, such as WarChild UK, Children in Conflict, Grenfell Foundation, etc. Efforts range in involvement, from marathons, to a simple purchase of a bracelet.

#### Paragraph 3 - Activities and Impact
We've gotten a private concert from Marcus, had a private tasting of Ted's cider, had Ben DJ for us, raffled off a Marcus signed football signed especially for Agora, chatted with Marcus Haney, and watched Ross Stirling climb the Matterhorn. We've infiltrated homes with bracelets, ornaments, posters, t-shirts, and pens. We've chatted on Zooms and hugged in person in London. We've celebrated the victories of buying The Big Party, reaching a large donation goal, and helped clean each other's merch closet out with our Chris Maas market.

#### Paragraph 4 - 2023 Achievements
In 2023 we raised over $14.000 with contributions to War Child, Children In Conflict and the Grenfell campaign.

#### Paragraph 5 - Recent Efforts
Through the past year, our Agora X community has donated to various targeted fundraising efforts, including the Syria/Turkey earthquake, Afghanistan appeal, Violence in Israel and Gaza, as well as worked with CIC and WC to create our own stand alone platform pages for Agora.

#### Paragraph 6 - Community Spirit
With every effort, the 7 admins of Agora X all gather on Zoom to talk about the effort and each time we say the same thing…. "We're blown away by our amazing community".

#### Paragraph 7 - Mission Statement
We're more than a charitable group… we're friends who've come together to help worthy causes. We are Agora X… where community and music intersect.
